# WorkWork Tokenomics

The $WW token is a central component of the WorkWork ecosystem, designed to incentivize meaningful engagement, promote platform growth, and provide utility in a variety of ways. The tokenomics of $WW are designed to ensure a sustainable and robust economic model that benefits users, contributors, and the broader community.

Airdrop Program\
Objective

The goal of the $WW airdrop program is to distribute tokens precisely to the most valuable users and contributors, minimizing the risk of airdrop farming and ensuring fair allocation.

Target Groups\
Bucket Who Qualifies Example Proofs\
Core Early Users Users who uploaded courses, posted jobs, or completed genuine transactions On-chain transaction records, order IDs, course/job IDs\
Community Contributors People who organized events, wrote tutorials, or supported ops/governance Event links, tutorial repos, governance/forum activity hashes\
AI Tool Adopters Users who materially used the AI assistant to optimize profiles/courses/projects AI usage logs (hashed), before/after quality scores\
Cross-Border Payments Users who completed verifiable settlements in WW or other crypto Settlement transaction hashes, invoice/receipt hashes\
Mechanics

Behavioral Mining (Points → WW): Users earn points for actions; quarterly snapshots convert points into WW tokens based on a published formula.

Growth-Tier Multiplier: Rewards are amplified for long-term, multi-dimensional contributors. Higher contributor levels (Beginner → Creator → Mentor → Curator) apply larger multipliers to the user’s score.

Streaming Issuance: To reduce dump risk and promote long-term engagement, $WW airdrop distribution is spread over multiple quarters via on-chain streaming and vesting, with recipients claiming tokens gradually.

Anti-Sybil & Integrity Guards: Minimum one genuine settlement is required before claiming, along with demonstrable AI-assistant usage, and anomalies screening for coordinated farming. Disqualified addresses will not receive allocations.

Token Utility\
Multi-Utility Overview\
Feature Description Mechanics\
Governance Voting Allows users to submit proposals that govern protocol fees, buy-back/burn ratios, treasury grants, and cross-chain expansion. Submitting proposals requires ≥ 1,000,000 WW. Voting window: 7 days with quorum and timelock on execution.\
Yield Share (Fee Revenue) Stake $WW or WW-LP to receive a share of net protocol fees (trading/matching/settlement). Fees flow to the treasury and are distributed per epoch to eligible stakers; exact split set by governance.\
veWW (Vote-Escrowed WW) Lock $WW to mint veWW for boosted governance power and higher reward multipliers. Configurable lock terms (1–48 months). veWW boosts governance weight, fee-share, and creator-grant weighting.\
Fee Discounts Discounts on marketplace trading fees, escrow/settlement, ads/featured listings. Tiered schedule (2% / 5% / 10% cap) based on $WW balance or veWW.\
Buy-Back & Burn A portion of net revenues used to repurchase and burn $WW. Frequency/ratio decided by governance. Burn address and monthly reports are public.\
Credits & Boosts Redeem $WW for AI assistant credits, ad credits, boost packs, or cross-border settlement fee offsets. Issued as on-chain vouchers; pricing/limits adjustable by governance.\
Creator Grants Grants for course creators, event organizers, and community tooling, decided by veWW voting. Streaming disbursements tied to milestones to prevent misuse.\
Issuance & Allocation

Total Supply: 1,000,000,000 WW (fixed, no inflation)

Token Use Cases & Stability Mechanisms

Token Use Cases:

Payment: $WW will be used as the primary payment token within the WorkWork platform for services like course fees, community contributions, and consultations.

AI Credits: Tokens will be redeemable for AI assistant credits to enhance product optimization and marketing strategies for users.

Governance: Holding $WW enables users to participate in governance processes and shape the future of WorkWork via community-driven proposals.

Liquidity & Stability:

Flow Payments: To maintain token price stability, WorkWork utilizes a streaming issuance model with gradual token release over time, helping to manage supply and demand.

Treasury Buy-Back & Burn: A portion of revenue from platform activities will be used to repurchase tokens, which will be burned to reduce circulating supply and increase token value over time.

Foundation Oversight: The foundation governs critical decisions, ensuring transparent and efficient management of funds, tokenomics, and ecosystem growth strategies.

By implementing these tokenomics, WorkWork aims to create a sustainable and incentivized ecosystem that encourages meaningful participation, facilitates real-time payments, and supports a community-driven platform that scales as the digital nomad ecosystem grows.
